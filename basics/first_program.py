# So well come to your first program in python.
# If you might have learned other languages you might know how to print, which means printing something (showing it through the terminal) using stdin (std input)
# It is really easy to just print something in python, in fact it can be achieved by a single line of code.
print("Hello, World!") # Remember to always close the string in double quotes.
# you can even print multiple values using , (I know this does not sound so helpful right now, but later, this is going to be really helpful)
print("I","am","learning","python")
# outputs --> I am learning python
# This is simple, but print function does not just does this, it also takes parameters.
# for example, you can separate them using the sep= function, which will separate each value by the specified string number anything.
print("I","am","learning","python", sep=", ") # add a space always or else the output will only use commas, and will not put space between them.
print("I","am","learning","python", end=" okay?\n" )
# try the above command it will about it in end
# so basically sep is between each word and end is after the whole thing has been completed
# you can even combine sep and end.
print("I","am","learning","python", sep=",", end=" okay?")
# don't worry about \n, we'll discuss it later
# now that you have completed print statement, proceed to <vars & esc_chars>
